\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
We presented LABNet, a Lasso-based approach to detect main genetic interactions from gene expression profiles.  Penalised regression in concert with a permutation-based procedure determines whether the predicted interactions are stable across experiments. 
The higher number of permutations not only improves the sensitivity of the method by reducing the number of false negatives, but it also determines the overall number of predicted edges. This does not seem to affect consistently the false positive rate. Due to the features that we have described and the promising results on synthetic data, the approach is a good candidate to further investigate and expand for the analysis of heterogeneous sources of genetic data.
